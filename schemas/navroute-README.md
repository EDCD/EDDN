# EDDN NavRoute Schema

## Introduction
Here we document how to take data from an ED `NavRoute` Journal
Event and properly structure it for sending to EDDN.

Please consult [EDDN Schemas README](./README-EDDN-schemas.md) for general
documentation for a schema such as this.

If you find any discrepancies between what this document says and what is
defined in the relevant Schema file, then you should, in the first instance,
assume that it is the Schema file that is correct.
**PLEASE open
[an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN/issues/new/choose)
to report any such anomalies you find so that we can check and resolve the
discrepancy.**

## Senders
The primary data source for this schema is the `NavRoute.json` file.  That 
it has been freshly written is signalled by the ED Journal event `NavRoute`.

So, monitor the Journal as normal, and when you see a `NavRoute` event open 
the `NavRoute.json` file for reading, read it, and close it again.  Use the 
data you got from reading this file, not merely the Journal event.

The primary data to be sent is the `Route` array from the contents of the 
separate file.

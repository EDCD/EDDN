## EDDN - Elite: Dangerous Data Network

The **Elite: Dangerous Data Network** is a system for willing Commanders to share dynamic data about the galaxy with others.  
By pooling data in a common format, tools and analyses can be produced that add an even greater depth and vibrancy to the [Elite Dangerous] universe.

EDDN is not run by or affiliated with [Frontier Developments](http://www.frontier.co.uk/).

Hosting has been very generously provided by [Vivio Technologies](https://www.viviotech.net/), until 2017.
